Python coding conventions
=========================

[PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) should be followed.

File names
----------

File names should be Python style, that is, words separated by underscores (e.g. `voluminous_octopus.py`).

When a virtual environment is used, it should be called `venv`. Any dependencies should be defined in `requirements.txt`.
