Issue tracker usage guidelines
==============================

If an issue doesn't seem to fit with any particular repository, file it against the `videogular-questions` repository.

The issue type should be described with a label (one of bug, enhancement, or investigate).

waffle.io and Sprint management
-------------------------------

We have a [waffle.io board](https://waffle.io/soton-ecs-2014-gdp-12/videogular-questions/) for tracking our Sprints.

Each Sprint will have a milestone on each repository, named "Sprint <number>", with the due date set to that of the Sprint Retrospective meeting. When an issue is added to a Sprint, it should be added to that Sprint's milestone.
